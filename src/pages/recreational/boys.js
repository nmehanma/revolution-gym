        <p>
          We believe gymnastics is the foundation for all sports. By improving
          strength, coordination, flexibility and balance, children will develop
          a great base to help them in all other physical activities. This fun
          60 minute class allows children to progress through our level system
          at their own pace and helps them to develop a positive and healthy
          self image. Mini Boys Classes - Ages 5-6.5 Jr. Boys Classes - Ages 7 -
