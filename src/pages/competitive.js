          Our competitive programs are entered through successful audition of
          girls ages 4+. Aspiring gymnasts need no previous experience and need
          not even be enrolled at the centre. Simple aptitude measuring
          activities help us to evaluate flexibility, strength, coordination,
          balance, listening ability and tenacity. Based on the results, the
          competitive staff will recommend the athlete to an appropriate
          program.
