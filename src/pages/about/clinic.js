        <p>
          Aaron arrived in Calgary energized and ready to work with our Alberta
          athletes and coaches! The gymnasts responded very well to his new
          ideas and coaching style. I loved his ‘developing grit’ session.
          Myself and my athletes left the camp motivated to work harder and
          reach our goals. Thank you so much Aaron for sharing your passion and
          expertise with us.

          “Gymnastics Saskatchewan had Aaron down for a Team Training Camp with
          our National & HP athletes in the Summer of 2018. He was attentive,
          prepared and worked with the athletes in a positive and supportive
          manner. The drills and technique suggestions he made to coaches helped
          us focus on areas of weakness and build on our strengths. We would
          highly suggest him to work with other club or provincial teams and
          would definitely have him back for future camps.”

          Aaron and Angela's session on Keys to Creating / Running a Thriving
          Gymnastics Business at the 2011 Gymnastics Ontario Congress was an
          absolute success. They are truly professionals in their field and
          participants had the opportunity to learn what makes a Gymnastics
          Business successful. It is amazing that as clinicians they are so
          eager and willing to share their 'secrets of success' to the general
          community for the betterment of our sport. We appreciated their
          candour and professionalism and will eagerly invite them to Congress
          again.

          "Aaron Brokenshire recently came to Alberta to be an event presenter
          at our annual Pre Novice Training Camp. He ran two training sessions
          in the gym, and one classroom session. All of our coaches in
          attendance really valued his creative ideas and vast experience to
          draw from. His expertise on bars, and in particular, his suggestions
          for a weekly training plan for HP athletes, was appreciated by our
          coaches due to its easy application in their own gyms. His friendly
          and efficient manner with the athletes, and his approachable manner
          with the coaches made him an excellent addition to our camp."

          "Aaron Brokenshire has been an instructor and clinician at Canadian
          Adventure Camp for a number of years. He is an expert clinician for
          the National Coaching Certification courses which we hold at the end
          of August each summer and his presentations involve adult coaches and
          child demonstrators. The residential nature of our camp means that I
          have a unique opportunity to observe staff at work and at play. Aaron
          is extremely professional at all times in his contact with my clients
          and with the youngsters who are demonstrating. He has wonderful
          charisma and an easy manner, making him very popular with all ages in
          camp. Aaron consistently achieves the highest possible ratings on our
          survey of customers at the end of each course. I cannot recommend him
          highly enough and feel very fortunate that he will again be teaching
          courses with us this coming summer."

          "It was great to have coach Aaron Brokenshire come to Woodward Camp
          with a group of his gymnasts. His uneven bar clinic showed natural
          progressions that were well thought out and explained. The most
          telling part of the clinic was how in tune his gymnasts were with what
          Aaron was talking about in regards to the progressions and corrections
          he was giving/discussing. Having Aaron and his athletes at camp this
          summer added a great deal to Woodward Camp for the staff, visiting
          coaches, and campers! I hope they'll be back soon!"
